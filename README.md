# chemicalReactionCalculator
A website to calculate the molecular weight, molar mass, and amount of different chemicals and balance chemicals reactions.

View the Project at: https://chemicalreaction.netlify.app/
(Still kinda broken, might redo the project in future using React)

As of currently the website works as a way to balance chemical reactions, get information about different elements and do quick conversions between moles and mass.
